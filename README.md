## My process

As mentioned in my previous solutions, I do the entire HTML first. Along with this, I do a little reset at the top of my styles.scss and import the fonts. Then I begin testing the CSS I have in mind in Chrome Dev Tools; that saves a lot of time.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

— The main thing I learned is the margin: auto. Also how to work more efficiently by first testing things in Chrome's DevTools, rather than writing my CSS directly in VS Code.

— Another 'super-cool' I learned is the mighty 'all: unset' property. It really is a game-changer when working with <button> tags...

### Continued development

Overall, I really dig the Frontend Mentor website. It's hands down the place I learned the most about coding. Every challenge I complete makes me more confident, and I kind of feel I'm really starting to think about myself like a coder... Maybe I'm delusional. Nevertheless, I plan to continue with the Front-End mentor challenges and will likely purchase the premium membership; I want to start doing more complex stuff and then eventually move to JS, as mentioned in my previous README files. I wonder if anyone is actually reading those... Let me know if you do...

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_margin.asp) - It may sound too newbie-ish but learning about the miraculous 'margin: auto' saved me tons of hassle.
